            <p>
                There are many ways to group tests together into test suites.
                One way is to simply place multiple test cases into a single file...
<php><![CDATA[
<strong><?php
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/simpletest/autorun.php');
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../classes/io.php');

class FileTester extends UnitTestCase {
    ...
}

class SocketTester extends UnitTestCase {
    ...
}
?></strong>
]]></php>
                As many cases as needed can appear in a single file.
                They should include any code they need, such as the library
                being tested, but need none of the SimpleTest libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have extended any test cases, you can include them too.
                Simply mark any test cases that should not be run as abstract...
<php><![CDATA[
<strong>abstract</strong> class MyFileTestCase extends UnitTestCase {
    ...
}

class FileTester extends MyFileTestCase { ... }

class SocketTester extends UnitTestCase { ... }
]]></php>
                Here the <code>FileTester</code> class does
                not contain any actual tests, but is a base class for other
                test cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will call this sample <em>file_test.php</em>.
                Next we create a test suite file, called say <em>my_test_suite.php</em>.
                You will think of a better name I am sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will add the test file using a safe method...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
require_once('simpletest/autorun.php');
require_once('file_test.php');

class AllFileTests extends TestSuite {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->addFile('file_test.php');
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                What happens here is that the <code>TestSuite</code>
                class will do the <code>require_once()</code>
                for us.
                It then checks to see if any new test case classes
                have been created by the new file and automatically adds
                them to the test suite.
                This method gives us the most control.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is too much typing, and you are willing to group
                test suites together in their own directories or otherwise
                tag the file names, then there is a more automatic way...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
require_once('simpletest/autorun.php');

class AllFileTests extends TestSuite {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->collect(dirname(__FILE__) . '/unit',
                       new SimplePatternCollector('/_test.php/'));
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                This will scan a directory called &quot;unit&quot; for any files
                ending with &quot;_test.php&quot; and load them.
                You don&apos;t have to use <code>SimplePatternCollector</code> to
                filter by a pattern in the filename, but this is the most common
                usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now all you have to do is drop a file of test cases into the
                directory and it will run just by running the test suite script.
            </p>
            <p>
                Test cases loaded with the <code>addFile</code> method have some
                useful properties.
                You can guarantee that the constructor is run
                just before the first test method and the destructor
                is run just after the last test method.
                This allows you to place test case wide set up and tear down
                code in the constructor and destructor, just like a normal
                class.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="higher" title="Composite suites">
            <p>
                The above method places all of the test cases into one large suite.
                For larger projects though this may not be flexible enough; you
                may want to group the tests in all sorts of ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get a more flexible group test we can subclass
                <code>TestSuite</code> and then instantiate it as needed...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
require_once('simpletest/autorun.php');
<strong>
class BigTestSuite extends TestSuite {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->addFile('file_tests.php');
    }
}</strong>
?>
]]></php>
                This effectively adds our test cases and a single suite below
                the first.
                Not much use as is, but we can add more than one suite at this point.
                We can even mix groups and test cases freely as long as
                we are careful about double includes.
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
require_once('simpletest/autorun.php');

class BigTestSuite extends TestSuite {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->addFile('file_tests.php');
        <strong>$this->addFile('some_other_test.php');</strong>
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                In the event of a double include, ony the first instance
                of the test case will be run.
